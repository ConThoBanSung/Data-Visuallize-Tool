# Data Visualization Tool

A Python-based tool for data analysis and visualization that allows users to load datasets, visualize data distributions, and train machine learning models (classification, regression, natural language processing, and large language models).

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Automatically analyzes the dataset to provide descriptive statistics and check for missing values.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize the relationships and distributions in the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Allows users to select from various machine learning models for classification, regression, NLP tasks, and LLMs (Large Language Models).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilizes Tkinter for file selection, making it easy to load datasets from CSV or Excel files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - keras
  - torch
  - transformers
  - tkinter
